## Title of project
Food-associated calls in disc-winged bats

## Authors
Gloriana Chaverri and Rachel A. Page

## General info
We studied if disc-winged bats, Thyroptera tricolor, emit food calls. Specifically, we aim to 1) describe the calls emitted while feeding and 2) test their effect on conspecifics. 

## Data
* [Data for number of calls emitted per individual](Calls_produced.csv)
Key to listed variables: Bat_ID = unique identifier of individuals, Trial = identifies whether the data correspond to the first, second or third trial, Audio = unique identifier of the audio file, N_calls = number of food calls emitted, Call = whether the bat called (1) or not (0), Audio length = number of seconds recorded, Naive = identifies individuals by whether it had been previously exposed to mealworms.

* [Results of experiment 1](E1_data.csv)
Key to listed variables: id = unique identifier of individuals, trial = identifies whether the data correspond to the first, second, third, fourth or fifth trial performed, stimulus = shows which stimulus was being presented in a given trial, occ = shows the number of occurrences of a feeeding attempt, dur = shows how long bats fed for, first = determines if this trial represented the first time in which the bat fed, first_graph = in words (yes or no) based on the previous column (first). 

* [Results of experiment 2](E2_data.csv)
Key to listed variables: id = unique identifier of individuals, obs = a unique identifier (based on the video's id) of the overall test perfomed on an individual, trial = identifies whether the data correspond to the first, second, or third trial performed on an individual, stimulus = shows which stimulus was being presented, pre_calls = shows whether the bat had been exposed to food calls during a given instance (row), pre_chew = shows whether the bat had been exposed to chewing sounds during a given instance (row), pre_pn = shows whether the bat had been exposed to pink noise during a given instance (row), playlist = unique identifier of the playlist used, dist_75_cm = represents the time (in seconds) that the bat spent in the 75 cm region, dist_50_cm = represents the number of visits that bats made to the 50 cm region.
